<p>Detailed information by hours on the price of electricity in Spain (PVPC) for efficient management of electricity consumption.</p>
<p>This App offers general and detailed information on the price of electricity (PVPC) and the cheapest and most expensive hours throughout a day to facilitate the adjustment of consumption habits by seeking savings in the electricity bill.</p>
<p>In short, this App tries to help manage electricity consumption more efficiently.</p>
<p>To use this App you only have to choose one of the three rates available in the PVPC and the day you want to consult. These three types of rates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.0 A. General rate (Default rate).</li>
<li>2.0 DHA. Nightly rate or hourly discrimination (Efficiency 2 periods).</li>
<li>2.0 DHS. Supervalle rate (Electric vehicle).</li>
</ul>
<p>The application supports two methods to obtain the data: with the official API (recommended) and from a file. To use the API you need to authenticate yourself with a personal access code (token) that is obtained free of charge by requesting it by email to consultaios@ree.es. The second method, extracting data from a file, is a slower, less efficient, and more error-prone process.</p>
